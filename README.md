## React Trello Clone V2

I've used this project as an exercise to learn some React. I'm in the process of updating this repository to use the latest version of React, but also using this as an opportunity to make some improvements in the process.

### Setup instructions

- Pull down the repo
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev`
- Navigate to the running version of the app on `http://127.0.0.1:5173/`

Hope this is useful to someone!
