# REWORK IN PROGRESS


# React Redux Trello clone with NodeJS, Mongo API

This is a work in progress basic clone version of trello. I am using this project to get some practical experience and further develop my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript applications using Front End frameworks, in conjunction with TypeScript based API's.

Being my first experience with working with React I have learnt through my time working on this project. I hope this will be beneficial for others learning. Feel free to clone the project and have a play around.
