# React Redux Trello clone with NodeJS, Mongo API

This is a work in progress basic clone version of trello. I am using this project to get some practical experience and further develop my knowledge and understanding of JavaScript applications using Front End frameworks, in conjunction with Javascript based API's.

## Getting Started

1. Create [MLabl](https://mlab.com/welcome/) account with database
1. Make a copy on the .env.example file, renaming to .env, within api root directory.
1. Update mongo credentials to point to your mongo DB instance
1. Run `npm install` in both api, app directories
1. Run `npm start` in api and app directories.

// instructions are incomplete -- Board creation and better routing coming soon to allow creation of initial board. 

## Future work

1. Install concurrently to start app and api simultaneously
1. Draggable cards and lists
1. Board creation and deletion
1. Board listing
1. Card search
1. ~Card clone~
1. ~List clone~
1. `reselect` integration
1. Unit tests with jasmine and jest
1. Delete board, clone board
1. Authentication and login
1. General style improvements and ui
1. More improvements not listed
